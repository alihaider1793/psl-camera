### v1.4.1

- Fixed a bug that would flip the front camera preview on some devices ([#112][112])
- Two new `CameraOptions` APIs: `o.getSupportedPictureSizes()` and `o.getSupportedPictureAspectRatios()` ([#101][101])
- Most controls (video quality, hdr, grid, session type, audio, white balance, flash, facing) now inherit
  from a base `Control` class ([#105][105]). This let us add new APIs:

  - `CameraView.set(Control)`: sets the control to the given value, e.g. `set(Flash.AUTO)`
  - `CameraOptions.supports(Control)`: returns true if the control is supported
  - `CameraOptions.getSupportedControls(Class<? extends Control>)`: returns list of supported controls of a given kind

## v1.4.0

- CameraView is now completely thread-safe. All actions are asynchronous. ([#97][97])
  This has some breaking drawbacks. Specifically, the `get` methods (e.g., `getWhiteBalance`) might
  not return the correct value while it is being changed. So don't trust them right after you have changed the value.
  Instead, always check the `CameraOptions` to see if the value you want is supported.
- Added error handling ([#97][97]) in `CameraListener.onCameraError(CameraException)`.
  At the moment, all exceptions there are unrecoverable. When the method is called, the camera is showing
  a black preview. This is a good moment to show an error dialog to the user.
  You can also try to `start()` again but that is not guaranteed to work.
- Long requested ability to set the picture output size ([#99][99]). Can be done through
  `CameraView.setPictureSize()` or through new XML attributes starting with `cameraPictureSize`.
  Please refer to docs about it.
- Deprecated `toggleFacing`. It was unreliable and will be removed.
- Deprecated `getCaptureSize`. Use `getPictureSize` instead.
- Fixed bugs.

### v1.3.1

- Fixed a bug that would make setFacing and other APIs freeze the camera ([#86][86])
- Fixed ConcurrentModificationExceptions during CameraListener callbacks ([#88][88])

https://github.com/natario1/CameraView/compare/v1.3.0...v1.3.1

## v1.3.0

- Ability to inject frame processors to do your own visual tasks (barcodes, facial recognition etc.) ([#82][82])
- Ability to inject external loggers (e.g. Crashlytics) to listen for internal logging events ([#80][80])
- Improved CameraUtils.decodeBitmap, you can now pass maxWidth and maxHeight to avoid OOM ([#83][83])
- Updated dependencies thanks to [@v-gar][v-gar] ([#73][73])
